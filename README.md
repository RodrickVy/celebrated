# Celebrated
A birthday reminder and card-sharing app for individuals, families and organizations

Expressing appreciation and love is essential to our humanity, yet our busy lives make it challenging to honour those important to us. Surprisingly, over 80% of Americans view their birthdays as special, second only to Christmas, highlighting a strong desire for celebration [Source 1.0][Source 1.1]. However, obstacles such as forgetting birthdays, lack of time for meaningful celebrations, repetitive celebration methods, budget constraints, and the struggle to unite people in organizations suggest a widespread feeling of being unappreciated [Source 1.2].

**Celebrated** aims to transform this scenario. Our mission is to enable people to show appreciation meaningfully and effortlessly. With the Celebrated app/website, you can:

- **Never forget birthdays** with phone, email, or WhatsApp reminders.
- **Send virtual gifts** with personalized notes and packaging.
- **Create unique birthday cards** for group signing.
- Enjoy **fun games** at birthday gatherings.
- **Easily collect birthday data** across organizations of any size.

We aim to shift the focus from monetary value to quality time, connection, and genuine appreciation. Celebrated's features are designed to ensure that celebrating your loved ones is simple, personal, and meaningful.
